Keywords:  
Mountain forest soils; digital soil mapping; geological substrate information; plant available water storage capacity; Alpine Environment

Highlights: 
- concept for predicting spatially continuous forest soil properties
- detailed geological substrate information as important predictor  
- Generalized Additive Models competitive to Random Forests
- integrating geographical coordinates accounts for spatial trends
